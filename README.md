# **Text Summarizer Model**

## **Overview**
This repository showcases a fine-tuned text summarization model developed using the **FLAN-T5** architecture. The project leverages **Hugging Face Transformers** and **Google Colab** to create a summarizer that extracts the essence of input text efficiently and accurately.

---

## **Features**
- **Fine-tuned Model**: Based on FLAN-T5, optimized for text summarization tasks.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Seamless model handling and testing.
- **Google Colab Notebook**: Includes detailed steps for training, fine-tuning, and testing.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
To use the notebook, ensure you have the following:
- **Python** (3.7+)
- Python Libraries:
  - `transformers`
  - `datasets`
  - `torch`
  - `scikit-learn`
- Access to **Google Colab** for running the notebook.

### **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone this repository or upload the provided `TextSummarizerModel.ipynb` notebook to Google Colab.
2. Install the required libraries in your Colab environment:
   ```bash
   !pip install transformers datasets scikit-learn

   
   ## **Execute the Notebook**
- Load and preprocess datasets.
- Fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model.
- Test the model on various text samples.

---

## **File Structure**
`TextSummarizerModel.ipynb`: A Colab notebook containing:
- Model training and fine-tuning workflow.
- Evaluation and testing setup.

---

## **Usage**
1. Open the `TextSummarizerModel.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells to:
   - Fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model or load pre-trained weights.
   - Test the model by inputting custom text for summarization.

---

## **Evaluation**
The model performance is assessed using industry-standard metrics:
- **ROUGE** (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores to gauge summary quality and relevance.

---

## **Deployment**
The fine-tuned model can be:
- Deployed to platforms like **Hugging Face Model Hub**.
- Integrated into applications requiring text summarization capabilities.
